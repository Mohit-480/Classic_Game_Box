# Classic_Game_Box
This is a personal python based project in which i have created few games and merge them together using GUI and all the games here are interactable and playable
But before you run these games you need to install few libraries
> pygame
> tkinter
> pillow
> subprocess
> os
Many of these libraries are preinstalled but if not first install them and then run the file.
> Simply use 'pip install filename' to install the libraries in the command prompt.
